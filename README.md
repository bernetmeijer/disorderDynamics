# disorderDynamics
Create phonon spectrum for disordered materials.

This code can produce phonon dispersion curves from disordered supercells, projected onto the first Brillouin zone of the unit cell.
Disorder can be of any type: for example mass, force or configurational disorder.
This code is based on the paper by Overy et al.: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pssb.201600586.

This code uses supercell eigenvector calculations in CASTEP format. These can be generated with the program GULP: https://gulp.curtin.edu.au/gulp/.
